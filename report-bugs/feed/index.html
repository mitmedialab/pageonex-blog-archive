Stuck at page 7 meant that even if I saved 20 pages, the result would show 7 pages saved. This went on for a long time but now I have manages to save the pages I needed.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Archana, 
Sorry about that. First: thanks for reporting the bug.

Could you provide url of the thread that failed?
What do you mean with &quot;stuck at page 7&quot;? I was going to suggest that: to save it often while coding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pageonex.com/report-bugs/#comment-9&quot;&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Andrew,
Do you mean &quot;uploading&quot; your own images? It good be a cool feature but it is not yet possible. We&#039;ve tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numeroteca/pageonex/issues/172&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to do that manually&lt;a / rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;, but it hasn&#039;t worked for the moment.

I would advise to remove those newspapers and work with the newspaper available. 

Another option: in the past other users have contacted kiosko.net, the archive where PageOneX is taking images from. If they upload the images to their archive, we&#039;ll be able to pull them to the PageOneX site.

thanks for reporting,
Pablo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pageonex.com/report-bugs/#comment-7&quot;&gt;David Busto&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Dave, 
we are making some inprovements to prevent the tool from crashing. When handling too many images (or too few) it could eventually crash. Try to reduce the number of images (or add ore days) and reload. 
Anyways, it is a good advice to save often. We are considering adding an autosave feature.

What 404 empty page did you found?
I saw once that css problem that you mention, I think it is solved now.

Sorry for the late response. thanks for reporting.

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I think the concept is great, but I found very dissapointing two things; first, when you bumped into a 404 empty page, the previous/following ones which had been highlighted are moved downwards -some css problem it seems- and finally, after doing some twenty pages of scaps, saving failed and I gave up traying again. A lot of work ahead! Greetings from Argentina, Dave.]]></description>

Fixed, PageOneX now includes La Nación (Argentina).  Enjoy!
