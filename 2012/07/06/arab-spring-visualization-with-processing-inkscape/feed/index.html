					<description><![CDATA[Some more comments:
1. (cont) the script produces a 3 layer svg file. The medium layer is the &quot;filter&quot;. I has already a transparency applied to it. YOu can also modify the transparency of a white rectangle.

2. (cont) in the script (https://github.com/numeroteca/PageOneX/blob/master/pageonex.pde) line 24, you can select the height of the newspaper:
&quot;int heightFrontPage = 1100; //height of the newspaper. the width is 750px. 1500px for US newspaper. 1100px for Spanish&quot;

3. (cont) To move objects from one layer to another in Inkscape, you need to
-Cut the object
-Select the layer you want to paste in
-Ctrl + Alt + V

4. (cont) To give context to the reader-viewer, it is essential to provide contextualized information to understand what was happening by then.

6. Please, trim the photo (downsize if necessary) and upload it to the Wordpress. Eventually also link it to the source in Dropbox, but we don&#039;t want to depend on third party hosting. Such a huge file makes the page load very slowly.

I hope to see a second version of it! Nice to see the first script being used and tested. It still has a lot of potential, but it requires to know a bit of Processing and Inkscape.]]></description>
